          Delay between seasons can sometimes trick our mind. Who killed Jennifer in the first part
          of previous season ? Why didn't Michael escape from the island with the treasure ? Why
          this background character gets so much in the new season trailer already ?

      At Synupsis, we aim to help people with quick reminders before they dive in their new season's
      favourite shows. Starting in mid 2022, Synupis results of a chit-chat between 2 friends.
      Synupsis had to be THE place where people can create seasons summaries, discuss about the
      latest tv shows gossip and, essentially, refresh memory. This project, seen as first as a
      challenge for the both of us, has seen the rise of AI and decision has been made : we'll use
      AI to generate summaries !
